    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const copy1 = players.slice()

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy2 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy3 = [...players]
    console.log(players, copy3);
    copy3[1] = 'Tony'
    console.log(players, copy3);

    const copy4 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const personCopy1 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99, number: 10 }) //shallow: one level deep

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const personCopy2 = { ...person } //shallow: one level deep

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const p = {
      name: 'Tim',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@coolman',
        facebook: '@coolman.developer',
      }
    }

    // 1.cloneDeep function from lodash

    // 2.JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(p)) - might have a performance issue
    const pCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(p))
